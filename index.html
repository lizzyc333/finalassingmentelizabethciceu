      <div class="about-heading">Hi, I’m Elizabeth.
        I love coffee,
        playing tennis,
        and my dog.</div>

      <img src="Group 14.png" alt="description of image">

      <p>
        Coffee is my ultimate daily indulgence, and I can’t imagine life without it. The rich, bold flavour brings me instant comfort, while the energizing boost gives me exactly what I need to power through tennis practice, class, or library sessions. With practice every day as a varsity tennis athlete, coffee has become my secret weapon, not just for energy but for the calm and focus it brings. Each cup is a moment of pure zen, helping me find balance and peace no matter how packed my schedule gets.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve played competitive tennis for as long as I can remember, mostly because my parents were passionate about the sport and were all for me going D1. But growing up, I hated it. The endless practices before and after school, the early mornings for weekend tournaments, it all felt like too much. By grade 10, I was burned out and quit during COVID, much to my parents’ disappointment. Now, playing varsity tennis at the University of Waterloo, I’ve rediscovered my love for the sport. I’ve fallen back in love with the game, not just for what it is, but because of the incredible teammates I’ve met and the lifelong friendships I’ve built through the team.
      </p>

      <p>

        After I quit tennis, I got my dog, Sage, and she instantly became a source of pure happiness for me and my whole family. Her cheerful energy and unconditional love helped me through a difficult time, and she brought so much warmth into our lives. Being away at school, I miss her more than anything, and every time I go home, the joy of seeing her excitement when I walk through the door is unmatched.
